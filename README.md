# CS50x Solutions

This repository contains solutions to the problems and projects from Harvard's **CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science** course. The course covers a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, memory management, security, and web development.

## Topics Covered

- **C Programming**: Foundational knowledge of computer science, including memory management, algorithms, and data structures.
- **Python**: Introduction to Python programming, covering both syntax and more advanced topics.
- **SQL**: Learn about relational databases and how to interact with them using SQL.
- **Web Development**: Implementing web applications with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask.
